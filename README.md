Expand donkey inventories to the capability of a double chest, 54 slots instead of 15, without external storage

## Usage

* Fabricate a chest item with `Donkey double chest` as lore, maybe with [FactoryMod](https://github.com/Civcraft/FactoryMod)
* Click on tamed, unchested donkey
* Open donkey, should now have 54 inventory slots instead of the regular 15
* You can saddle it by placing a saddle in the first slot of inventory

## Features

* Does not use any kind of external storage, only NMS methods and NBTs
* Donkeys drop loot normally (except the lored chest)
